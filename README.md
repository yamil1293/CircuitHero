## Installation
Create a new Unity Project and then replace the Assets & Project Settings folders with the files from this repository in order to run this build.

## Instructions
Circuit Hero was created in Unity3D and was meant to be a 2D platformer where the Player would be able to jump, shoot and dash, similar to the Megaman X series. The game can only be played by one Player and can move around with the basic controls in an enclosed area.

* Created using Unity3D and used Microsoft Visual Studio for scripting
* Based on a tutorial provided by Unity Technologies, Brackeys & Sebastian Lague
